Feature: Locking reminders

  Background:
        Given there is 1 project with the following:
              | identifier | dingens |
              | name       | dingens |
          And the project "dingens" uses the following modules:
              | reminders |
          And there is 1 user with:
              | login | bob |
          And there is a role "user"
          And the user "bob" is a "user" in the project "dingens"
          And there is 1 reminder in project "dingens" created by "bob" with:
              | title | Bobs reminder |
          And the reminder "Bobs reminder" has 1 agenda with:
              | text  | awesome! |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Save a reminder after it has changed while editing
      Given the role "user" may have the following rights:
            | view_reminders |
            | create_reminders |
            | create_reminder_agendas |
            | edit_reminders |
       When I am already logged in as "bob"
        And I go to the reminders page for the project called "dingens"
        And I click on "Bobs reminder"
        And I follow "Edit" within ".reminder_agenda"
            # Change the text of the agenda to create an editing conflict
        And the reminder "Bobs reminder" has 1 agenda with:
            | text | and now for something completely different |
        And I fill in "Blabla oder?" for "reminder_agenda_text"
        And I click on "Save"
       Then I should see "Information has been updated by at least one other user in the meantime."
            # Pr√ºfen, ob die Editbox noch sichtbar ist
       #And I should see "Text formatting" within "#tab-content-agenda"
